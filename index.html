                <h3>Report</h3>
                <p>This webpage uses CSS Grid to organize its
                    contents, dividing the page into four rows and five
                    columns of different sizes. Area 1 centers its image using
                    the "display:flex" and "justify-content:center" properties. Additionally,
                    the image in Area 1's selector is modified with a height less than 100px,
                    accouting for the padding around each div. Area 2 includes two headers, 
                    centered both vertically and horizontally with a nested div. Area 3's overflow
                    property is set as 'scroll,' containing text to the div without 
                    cutting any of the report out. Table 4 contains a centered table element,
                    with its tr and td elements styled to have borders, color-banded rows,
                    and change colors on hover.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Area 5 contains an image of the OSI Model related to CIS 457, that scales its
                    width with respect to the browser window. Area 6 builds a list of companies, represented
                    by abbreviations, in a <b>ul</b>. Each <b>li</b> is an anchor tag
                    that links to each company's homepage. Area 6 centers its contents both vertically 
                    and horizontally by using the 'subarea' with a nested div, as introduced in Area 2.
                    Area 7 includes excerpts from GVSU's Java Coding Style Guide, included as a source with an
                    anchor tag in the header. Area 7 includes text from the guide to display use of the <b>b</b>,
                    <b>i</b>, and <b>code</b> tags. Area 8 contains 6 <b>img</b> tags embedded within <b>a</b> tags, linking to each platform.

                <p>
                    The <i>size</i>, <i>age</i>, and <i>complexity</i> of software is growing. Programmers now spend more time reading, maintaining, and enhancing code than 
                    they do writing original code. Therefore, it is critical that a professional programmer not only be able to write efficient and 
                    correct code, but it must also be written in a style that others can understand.
                </p>
                <p>Coding standards are used by an organization to help everyone work more reliably together, improve quality, reduce development time, 
                    and allow quicker maintenance. Your guiding principle when writing code should be whether the reader will easily understand what 
                    you mean and what the code does. <b>Well-designed, well-written code is a joy to debug, maintain, and enhance.</b></p>

                <h5>Comments</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Comments should be used to give overviews of code and provide additional information that is not readily available in the code itself. 
                        Comments should contain only information that is relevant to reading and understanding the program. Avoid duplicating information that 
                        is clearly evident in the code.
                    </li>
                    <li>Javadoc comment must begin with <code>/**</code> and end with <code>*/</code></li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Method Headers</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Provide headers for every method that includes horizontal lines to make the header visually distinctive.
                        Use two blanks lines before each method header. Use Javadoc <code>@param</code>, <code>@return</code>,
                        and <code>@throws</code> tags where appropriate. See sample code below.
